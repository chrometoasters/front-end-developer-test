# Chrometoaster Front-end developer pre-meeting task

Thanks for taking the time to complete this pre-meeting task. It's not a test â€” please don't think of it like that, there's no 'right answer'. It's an intentionally open brief that allows both parties to talk about approaches to front-end development. Why you do a particular thing, in a particular way, is as much of interest to us as whether it's best practice or not.

### The task:
Please build the wireframe supplied in PSD format (complete with authentically named layers) into a working HTML template.

### Important notes:
* Return a set of HTML, and associated assets, that allows us to view the page inside a browser.
* Please focus on layout and semantic structure, rather than making the page look beautiful or accurately matching the PSD.
* Please do not use any CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap.
* The page only needs to work in modern browsers; do not worry about support for legacy versions.
* The template should be responsive (preferably mobile-first); it's up to you to interpret how the layout would work at a narrow width.
* The button should hide and show the notification below it using JavaScript.
* Please provide the sourcecode used to build the site.
